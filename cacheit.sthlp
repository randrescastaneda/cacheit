{it: command} is any native or user written command available in Stata.



{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
The {cmd:cacheit} command allows for all output and returned elements of any
commands to be saved (cached), and reloaded in the future without re-running the 
command. When {cmd:cacheit} is used, it will check if the indicated command has been 
previously issued  and cached by the user, and if so reload all elements returned 
by the command, along  with command output, without re-running the command itself. 
Otherwise, if no previously cached result for the command exists, 
{cmd:cacheit} will run the command, and cache all output and returns for future uses.

{pstd}
{cmd:cacheit} is useful if slow or resource-intensive commands are run more than once, 
as after the first time they are run all output can be simply accessed from the 
previously saved version, saving on all processing time. {cmd:cacheit} works with all valid 
Stata commands and is issued as a {help prefix} before the desired command.

{pstd}
{cmd:cacheit} stores all command output for the future, or loads all elements returned 
or otherwise altered by the command including (where relevant): elements accessible after
the command in the ereturn, sreturn or return lists; graphical output; any alterations 
to data (unless {it:nodata} is specified); any alterations to {help frames} 
(unless {it:nodata} is specified).


{marker remarks}{...}
{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
One of either

{phang2}
{cmd:cacheit} [{cmd:,} {it:{help cacheit##opt_table:options}}] {cmd::} {help cacheit##command:{it:command}}

{pstd}
or

{phang2}
{cmd:cacheit} {it:{help cacheit##sbc_table:subcommand}} [{cmd:,} {it:{help cacheit##opt_table:options}}]

{pstd}
should be issued. The use of {help cacheit##sbc_table:subcommand}s is for general management 
of {cmd:cacheit} and should not be combined with individual commands to be cached.  Otherwise
the standard usage of {cmd:cacheit}{cmd::} {help cacheit##command:{it:command}} will cache or 
load the output of {help cacheit##command:{it:command}}.


{marker subcommands}{...}
{title:Subcommands}


{phang}
{opt clean} Indicates that all contents of cached commands should be permanently removed from
the cache directory.  Typing {cmd:cacheit clean} will result in a confirmation message to which
the user must respond "y" if all contents of the cache directory should be cleared.  This option
should be used with care, as any contents of the cache directory will be permanently deleted.
To avoid issues with potential loss of important information, the {opt clean} sub-command does
NOT work recursively.  For example, if various projects are located within a main cache subfolder,
these must be cleaned individually by using the {opt dir()} and/or {opt project()} options.
 
{phang}
{opt list} Lists the full history of cached commands available for re-loading in the current
cache directory.  



{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}


{phang}
{opt dir(string)} Specifies the directory where cached command outputs will be saved 
for later retrieval. If not specified, the default location is a _cache subdirectory 
within the current working directory. To set a different default cache directory, 
define the path in the global macro {opt cache_dir} within your 
{help profile:profile.do} file or at the beginning of your do-file. The _cache 
subdirectory will be created inside the directory specified in global 
{opt cache_dir}.

 
{phang}
{opt project(string)} Allows for sub-folders within the cache directory if further control of 
cached contents is desired.  This permits cached commands to be stored in groups of related 
commands.

{phang}
{opt prefix(string)} By default, all cached contents of a command will be saved with a prefix 
of _ch followed by the hash of the command as typed, along with the data signature of data in 
memory. The prefix option will replace _ch with the indicated string

{phang}
{opt nodata} If nodata is specified, {cmd:cacheit} will save all command returns, but will not 
save data if any changes in data are detected.  This may be desired if data in memory is
very large, and the command issued makes innocuous changes to the data that are not required
in the future.  Note that by default, any regression-based commands will save resulting data,
given that a variable is generated to store information about the estimation sample via
e(sample).  Thus, care should be taken if {opt nodata} is used with regression-based commands,
as the use of e(sample) will not be available.

{pmore} This option should be used with care, as in future calls to {cmd:cacheit} all command
output and results will be returned, but updates to data will not be produced.

{phang}
{opt datacheck(string)} By default {cmd:cacheit} tests data in memory and the command syntax,
and determines that a command has been cached if data in memory is identical and the command as
typed is identical.  However, at times external data files may be called which have identical names,
but altered contents.  In cases such as this, {opt datacheck} can be used to indicate that 
{cmd:cacheit}
should also ensure that any external data files necessary for the command are also included when 
generating a unique command identifier, or checking whether an identical command has previously
been cached.  As many data files can be indicated in {opt datacheck} as desired, and the name of each
Stata data file should simply be separated by white space.

{phang}
{opt framecheck(string)} Allows for identical behaviour as in {opt datacheck}, but now by testing
the precise contents of any frames indicated in {opt framecheck}.  As many frames can be indicated 
in {opt framecheck} as desired, and the name of each frame should simply be separated by white space.

{phang}
{opt clear} Allows command implementation to proceed even if this would unsaved changes in 
data (similar, for example, to {it: use, clear})

{phang}
{opt hidden} By default {cmd:cacheit} returns all stored results, including hidden results as standard 
stored results, and so hidden results will be visible following {cmd: cacheit}.  If you would like hidden  
elements to stay hidden, the {opt hidden} option should be specified.
 See
{mansection P returnRemarksandexamplesUsinghiddenandhistoricalstoredresults:{it:Using hidden and historical stored results}}
and
{mansection P returnRemarksandexamplesProgramminghiddenandhistoricalstoredresults:{it:Programming hidden and historical stored results}}
under {it:Remarks and examples} of {bf:[P] return} for more information. 

{phang}
{opt replace} Forces {cmd:cacheit} to re-run the command and re-cache results, even if a 
previously cached version of command output has been found. The use of {opt replace} may be useful 
if commands are re-issued and command behaviour has changed.

{phang}
{opt keepall} Indicates that elements stored by previous commands in e(return) and s(return)
lists should not be cleared prior to invoking the command requested with {cmd:cacheit}.
By definition, {cmd:cacheit} will store all elements returned in ereturn, sreturn or return lists
following an issued command.  The default usage is to clear ereturn, sreturn and return
lists prior to issuing the requested command, so that only elements from the issued command
will be returned in future calls to the command from cacheit.  However, this implies that
elements of return lists not used by a specific command will not hold over from previous
commands, for example if an r-class command is issued, results from previous e-class commands
will be cleared to avoid being saved by {cmd:cacheit}.  If such behaviour is undesired, 
the {opt keepall} option should be used so that any previous return lists are maintained in
memory.


{marker global}{...}
{title:Global control}

{pstd}
Standard {cmd:cacheit} behaviour can also be controlled by using a number of global variables.
Specifically, the following globals can be set, and if these are set, these will override any
default behaviour.  

{synoptset 24 tabbed}{...}
{synopthdr:Global name and value}
{synoptline}
{synopt :{opt cache_replace} replace}Automatically activates the replace option, overwriting the cache each time.{p_end}
{synopt :{opt cache_on} off} Bypasses caching entirely (effectively ignoring the {it: cacheit:} prefix if present).{p_end}
{synopt :{opt cache_prefix} string} Define a prefix for saving cached contents, overriding the default {it: _ch} used in the prefix
option with any {it: string} defined by the user.{p_end}
{synopt :{opt cache_dir} dir_name} Define a default location for saving cached
contents, overriding the default  {it: _cache} directory with any {it: dir_name} defined by the user.{p_end}
{synopt :{opt cache_project} dir_name} Define a default location within the cache
directory to store cached output with any  {it: dir_name} defined by the user.{p_end}
{synoptline}
{pstd}

{pstd}
This allows for permanent control of {cmd:cacheit} for the entire duration a global is set.
If such global control is detected by cacheit, a note will be provided to users warning that global
control is detected.  Note that if both global control is set {it: and} a command option is set,
the command option will be take primacy.  For example, if the {opt cache_project} global is set to 
{it: my_sub_project}, all cached commands will be stored in a directory named in this fashion. 
However if a specific call to cacheit then also indicates {opt project(my_main_project)}, this 
specific cached command will be placed in the my_main_project directory.


{marker examples}{...}
{title:Examples}

{pstd}
The examples below illustrate the idea of {cmd:cacheit}.  These are based on 
Stata's auto dataset.

{ul:Basic examples}

{phang}
Load Stata's auto dataset, and cache a command

{phang2}
{cmd:. sysuse auto}{p_end}
{phang2}
{cmd:. cacheit: regress price weight length}

{phang}
Now, inspect return list and ereturn list to see elements returned by the {help regress} command

{phang2}
{cmd:. return list}{p_end}
{phang2}
{cmd:. ereturn list}

{phang}
Now, issue alternative command so that return lists will be altered

{phang2}
{cmd:. cacheit: sum price weight length}

{phang}
Finally, call cacheit again, and confirm that cacheit has reloaded all original command output 
without re-running the command:


{phang2}
{cmd:. cacheit: regress price weight length}{p_end}
{phang2}
{cmd:. return list}

{txt}                 ({stata "cacheit_examples cacheit_ex01":click to run})

{ul:An example documenting time savings}

{phang}
Load Stata's auto dataset, set a timer, cache a command which will take considerable time to run
and then turn off the timer

{phang2}
{cmd:. sysuse auto}{p_end}
{phang2}
{cmd:. timer on 1}{p_end}
{phang2}
{cmd:. cacheit: bootstrap, reps(5000) dots(100): reg price mpg}{p_end}
{phang2}
{cmd:. timer off 1}

{phang}
Now, set a second timer and run the command from the cached version:

{phang2}
{cmd:. timer on 2}{p_end}
{phang2}
{cmd:. cacheit: bootstrap, reps(5000) dots(100): reg price mpg}{p_end}
{phang2}
{cmd:. timer off 2}{p_end}
{phang2}
{cmd:. timer list}

{txt}                 ({stata "cacheit_examples cacheit_ex02":click to run})


{ul:An example with post-estimation}

{phang}
Load Stata's food_consumption dataset and implement resource-heavy demandsys

{phang2}
{cmd:. webuse food_consumption, clear}{p_end}
{phang2}
{cmd:. cacheit: demandsys quaids w_dairy w_proteins w_fruitveg w_flours w_misc, prices(p_dairy p_proteins p_fruitveg p_flours p_misc) expenditures(expfd) demographics(n_kids n_adults) labels(Dairy Meats FruitVeg Flours Misc) nolog}{p_end}

{phang}
Now, also cache the post-estimation command, which requires elements from previous command, so {opt keepall} is specified:

{phang2}
{cmd:. cacheit, keepall: estat elasticities, uncompensated}{p_end}

{txt}                 ({stata "cacheit_examples cacheit_ex03":click to run})

{marker returns}{...}
{title:Stored results}{p 50 20 2}{p_end}

{pstd}
{cmd:cacheit} is itself an {helpb return:rclass} command, and along with all
elements returned from the requested command, additionally stores the 
following in {cmd: r()}:

{synoptset 23 tabbed}{...}
{p2col 5 23 26 2: Macros}{p_end}
{synopt:{cmd:r(call_hash)}} The {help mf_hash1:hash} of the command as issued by the user{p_end}
{synopt:{cmd:r(datasignature)}} The {help datasignature} of the data prior to command being invoked{p_end}
{synopt:{cmd:r(cmd_hash)}} The {help mf_hash1:hash} used by cacheit to uniquely identify the command{p_end}
